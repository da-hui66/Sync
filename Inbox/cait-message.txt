I get most of what you're trying to convey, it's not too much. I know it's difficult through the text message medium and given the variables, I'm not sure I could do any better, but I hear you and understand. I apprecaite you explaining why you feel the way you do. Thank you for you honesty. I'm absolutely okay with you having your reservations about any of this. I relate significantly to much of your response. I mentioned how guarded and reserved I typically am, but you seem to have been given a pass. I beleive this is due to the same comfortability that you find in me, I find with you.

Get to know me better, and I'm more than confident you'll feel at ease. Your love of music feels as strongly as mine. Please let me assure you, there was never any reserversation about attending a concert with you specifically. The plans being some time away wasn't for any reason other than that's when they happen to be scheduled. I suppose the plans made themselves and if you're willing and able then ofcourse you're the person to go with. ZB was serendipitous, and I'm thrilled that it came about. I think if there was anyone I've known in the last few years or so that I would want to go to his show with, that would "get it" and apprecaite it for what it is, that's certainly you.
