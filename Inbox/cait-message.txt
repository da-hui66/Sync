Milk washing (or milk clarification) is a technique used in mixology to clarify and mellow alcoholic drinks—basically making cocktails smoother, clearer, and sometimes even shelf-stable.

## HOW ##
---------
1. mix alcohol with acidic ingredients, like citrus juice
2. add milk, usually whole milk
3. acidity causes the milk to curdle—the curds trap a bunch of impurities and harsh compounds
4. strain the mixture (usually through a fine strainer or coffee filter), removing the curds
5. left with a clearer, smoother drink with a velvety mouthfeel and more subtle flavors

## WHY ##
-----------
- clarifies the drink (it can turn cloudy cocktails crystal clear)
- smooths out harsh flavors
- adds body without a milky taste
- preserves the drink longer (since the curds remove a lot of spoilable elements)
