-- Continued from earlier:

There's a reason that fear exists, because of pain I witnessed in my mother's eyes that I would never want to cause her. I am doing the best I can to avoid that fear, truthfully that wasn't always the case, there is much to unpack there but I'll leave you with that for now.
I have four brothers, and we are all close to our mother in different ways. I can tell you more of that history if you’re interested in time.

Why do I hold back from sharing music? Well, if you haven't determined already most answers I give are not simple, not because I'm complicated, but rather because I spend a lot of time and energy in introspection. I'll admit that one of my hobbies is continual self-improvement, and as an extension of that self-discovery and self-reliance. Each day I get to live in this world I see it as an opportunity to be better than I was the day before. Whether that is striving to be a better brother, son, lover, friend, uncle, co-worker, employee, stranger, neighbor, any or all those things. My point here is that in this pursuit I often turn to music as inspiration to explore my thoughts and feelings in ways that I may not fully understand and need to take time to process. I have come to know that my relationship with music exists somewhere on a visceral plane and because of this it communicates certain feelings that I may not be ready to share. Sometimes when I do share music, these things will come across to people because I get lost in the way the music and those feelings can enrich our souls. There typically is a vulnerability that exists if one is aware, and that can be intimidating. Not that I want to hide anything or be inauthentic, I suppose there is often a right place and a right time that I've tried to be more patient of as I've grown.

The big fear of dying. I get that, it's likely true for most people. It's a tough one to grapple with. The mystery and meaning of life after death. This fear is valid one to have, all the religions of the world try to explain this in a way that our rational minds can comprehend and find peace with. I certainly understand this fear and I appreciate you offering this perspective on yourself.

It's nice to get to know you in a way that most people don’t get to know one another these days, and we haven’t even had the chance to have a ‘real’ conversation yet.
