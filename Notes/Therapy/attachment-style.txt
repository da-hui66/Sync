So - does any of this sound familiar? 

You care deeply about emotional depth and connection in relationships…and yet… you can find yourself feeling stressed or feeling trapped when people get too close to you or expect too much


Even when you’re in strong relationships, you can be suspicious of people, often scanning for signs of betrayal or wondering if they really do like you.

When you “over-give” – you can feel taken advantage of, only to feel angry and resentful later.

You may have had several relationships where you felt unseen and weren’t reassured, and ended up telling yourself things like “I can’t trust people” or “My needs don’t matter to others”.

You start off easily connecting with people when dating, but often get cold feet around big commitments or when things get more serious


You often find yourself in on-again-off-again relationships because you can’t decide whether you want to stay or leave (and this might even be a long-standing pattern for you)

If any of this rings a bell then … 

Your attachment style is: fearful avoidant.
